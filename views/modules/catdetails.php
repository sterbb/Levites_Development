                                      Come prepared to learn: Bring a notebook and pen to take notes during the workshop. This will help you remember key concepts and techniques discussed.

                                      Active participation: Engage in discussions and ask questions. This workshop is designed to be interactive and collaborative, so your active participation will greatly enhance the learning experience.

                                      Familiarize yourself with the church's analog mixer: During the workshop, we will be focusing on the specific analog mixer used by our church. Take some time before the workshop to familiarize yourself with the layout, controls, and features of the mixer.

                                      Hands-on practice: We will provide opportunities for hands-on practice with the analog mixer. Make the most of these practice sessions to develop your skills and gain confidence in operating the mixer.

                                      Collaboration and knowledge sharing: Engage with fellow participants, share your experiences, and learn from one another. This collaborative environment will foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for analog mixers in a church setting.

                                      We're excited to explore the world of analog mixers together and discover how they can enhance our worship services.
